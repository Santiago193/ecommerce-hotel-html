3D models folder.
This directory contains external .glb files used by the project.

The model "mascota.glb" is NOT included because it exceeds GitHub's maximum file size limit (25 MB).
To obtain or recreate this model, follow these steps:

1. Go to the website PolyPizza (https://poly.pizza/) and search for a human or mascot-style 3D character.
2. Download the character in a format that supports animation, such as **FBX**.
3. Open the FBX file in any 3D tool that supports exporting, such as Blender, Mixamo, or an online FBX-to-GLB converter.
4. Export or convert the model to **.glb** format.
5. Place the resulting file inside the following directory in the project:

src/main/webapp/images3d/

These assets are stored separately due to their large size.
